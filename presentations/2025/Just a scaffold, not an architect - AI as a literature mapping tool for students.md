## 💡 Just a scaffold, not an architect: AI as a literature mapping tool for students

### The Challenge

* **Graduate students often struggle to see the full interdisciplinary scope of their research topics.**
* The rise of Generative AI presents a further challenge, as students' unguided use of these tools can lead to **superficial** (or ethically and epistemologically fraught) engagement rather than deeper inquiry.
* There is a clear pedagogical need for **structured, responsible methods of integrating AI** into the research process that **foster, rather than replace, critical thinking** and mature research habits.

### The Intervention: AI as Cartographer

* This intervention pilots an **"AI-assisted literature mapping"** assignment in a graduate writing course which frames AI's role as a **"recommender engine."**
* Students use a **single, structured prompt** that tasks an LLM with identifying relevant academic disciplines and perspectives and generating potential library catalog search queries for a topic the student is interested in researching.
* Students are guided to the published literature via library catalog searches.
* This structured approach provides a **scaffold** for students (Vygotsky, 1978) to practice **"boundary crossing"** (Akkerman & Bakker, 2011) and engage in **"scholarship as conversation"** (American Library Association, 2016).



#### Student prompt sent to GenAI tool

> **I want to research the impact of AI on employment**
>
> **You will help me map the literature for this topic.**
>
> Please give me a list of different academic **disciplines and subfields** that might have something to say about this topic.
>
> For each field, provide a **summary of their contributions** to the topic or issue as well as a **summary of their concerns** about the issue.
>
> Finally, also include a **list of suggested search queries** I can use to find relevant scholarly sources in a university library catalog.

#### Example output format for our literature map:

* Field name
    * **Relevant subfields:**
    * **Contributions:**
    * **Concerns:**
    * **List of suggested search queries:**

#### Excerpt of responses from Gemini 2.5 Flash
*(Sections of the excerpt are transcribed below as they appear on the poster)*

**1. Economics**
* **Relevant subfields:** Labor Economics, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Technology & Innovation.
* **Contributions:** Primarily focused on analyzing the **quantitative impact of AI** on job markets, wages, and productivity. They assess how AI-driven automation affects different sectors, what kind of jobs are most susceptible to displacement or augmentation, and the potential for new job creation. Their work offers models for understanding the overall economic shifts caused by AI.
* **Concerns:** Key concerns include **worsening income inequality**, the potential for **mass technological unemployment** (the "jobs apocalypse"), and the need for policy interventions such as Universal Basic Income (UBI) or retraining programs to mitigate negative effects. They also worry about the reliability and ethical implications of economic forecasts that don't adequately account for the speed of AI development.
* **List of suggested search queries:**
    * "AI and labor market impact"
    * "Automation and wage inequality"
    * "Economic models of artificial intelligence"
    * "UBI and technological unemployment"

**2. Sociology (and Political Science)**
* **Relevant subfields:** Social Stratification, Political Economy, Social Inequality, Future of Work.
* **Contributions:** Sociologists examine AI's impact on the **social fabric, power structures, and distribution of opportunities**. They focus on how AI can exacerbate existing social inequalities (based on race, class, gender, etc.), reshape professional identities, and influence organizational structures. Political scientists look at the **policy and regulatory challenges**, including labor laws, international competition, and the role of government in managing a transition to an AI-driven economy.
* **Concerns:** They worry about the **concentration of economic and political power** in the hands of a few tech companies, leading to a breakdown of democratic institutions or increased surveillance. They emphasize the risk of AI-driven job displacement creating a **new "precariat" class** and the potential for a deeper, structural increase in social unrest and polarization. They also focus on the need for international cooperation to regulate AI development.
* **List of suggested search queries:**
    * "AI, social inequality, and class structure"
    * "Automation and social stratification"
    * "Future of work sociological perspective"
    * "AI labor policy and regulation"

**3. Computer Science and Engineering**
* **Relevant subfields:** Robotics, Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
* **Contributions:** Professionals in this field focus on **developing the technologies** behind AI and automation. They study the **feasibility and practical implementation** of AI systems in various industries. Their research explores the limits of automation, the design of safe and reliable AI, and how to create AI systems that can effectively collaborate with, or augment, human workers rather than completely replacing them.
* **Concerns:** They are concerned with the **technical challenges** of ensuring AI systems are **reliable, safe, and free from bias** (e.g., algorithmic bias leading to unfair hiring decisions). They also worry about the **ethical use of the technologies** they create, especially in areas like autonomous weapons or mass surveillance, and the potential for their work to be misused, leading to job loss or increased power asymmetry.
* **List of suggested search queries:**
    * "AI job displacement human factors"
    * "The future of collaboration human-robotics"
    * "Algorithmic bias in hiring decisions"
    * "AI-powered worker augmentation"

#### Some real student "Aha!" moments:

* "This surprised me because I only thought about **efficiency**... I didn't think about **labor or economics** being affected."
* "The map **broadens my idea** of this topic... there's no single correct answer for the issues we care about."
* "This went **beyond my prior knowledge** and caught my eye!"

### Outcomes & Key Insights

* **High Metacognitive Engagement:** Student reflections demonstrated a **high level of metacognitive activation**. Students reported that the activity prompted them to think critically about the research process, including their ability to cross interdisciplinary lines and join a broader, more richly contextualized conversation about their topics of interest.
* **Shift in Perspective on AI:** The activity provided a positive and concrete model for the **ethical use of AI in research**, building student confidence in using AI as a **brainstorming partner**, not as a source of final truth or as a replacement for human thought and authorship.

### Implications for Teaching

* **A Practical Model for Responsible AI Integration:** This assignment serves as a **replicable, low-stakes model** for instructors who want to integrate GenAI into their courses in a way that **enhances, rather than undermines**, traditional literature review and research skills.
* **Fostering Student Agency:** By putting the student in the role of the prompter and analyst, the assignment **empowers students to take ownership** of their research trajectory from the beginning and encourages a less siloed and more interdisciplinary literature-grounded approach to their scholarly work.
