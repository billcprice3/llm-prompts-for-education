### Prompt engineering and repositories

- Here is one common framework for how to assign a task to a conversational AI:
    1. **Tell it who you are.** Example: "I'm an ESL instructor developing study materials."
    2. **Tell it what the project is.** Example: "I'm looking for texts that effectively illustrate the meanings of target vocabulary words for my students."
    3. **Tell it what you want it to do.** Example: "I want you to write a paragraph that uses each of these target vocabulary words one time."
    4. **Tell it how to write the output.** Example: "The paragraph should be about ... The level of complexity should be ... Use/avoid this grammar ..."

- [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/patterns): A repository of prompts by Daniel Miessler. They are not specific to education, but provide excellent examples of what an engineered prompt can look like. See some of Miessler's examples below:

    - [Create Keynote](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/create_keynote/system.md) prompt that instructs the AI to create a slide-by-slide plan for a presentation

    - [Extract Wisdom](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/extract_wisdom/system.md) prompt that instructs the AI to "extract surprising, insightful, and interesting information from text content"

### Chat-Based Generative AI Tools (as of March 2024)

#### Commercial (online)

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): A conversational AI developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text responses. It's known for its wide range of applications, from answering questions to writing creative content.

- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com): A conversational AI developed by Google, designed to provide information and perform tasks through natural language understanding.

- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/): Microsoft's conversational AI assistant that integrates with various Microsoft products to enhance productivity by automating tasks, generating content, and providing insights based on natural language prompts.

#### Open-Source (offline)

- [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/): A free program for downloading and running open-source conversational AIs locally on your own computer. As of March 2024, I recommend using the model called Nous Hermes 2 Mistral DPO.

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/): Similar to GPT4All, but considered to be less user-friendly and more advanced.

### Image-Based Generative AI Tools

- [DALLÂ·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3/): A model by OpenAI that can generate detailed images from textual descriptions, offering creative possibilities in visual content creation.

- [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/): An independent research lab's image synthesis tool that explores new mediums of thought and expands the imaginative powers of the human species.

- [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/stable-image): A text-to-image AI by Stability AI that enables users to create images from textual descriptions, emphasizing accessibility and ease of use.
