# Let’s Demystify AI and Take Initiative: A Workshop By and For Educators

#### Bill Price, with AI assistance

## Introduction

Generative AI has exploded into the public consciousness over the last year and a half, including text-based tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and image-based tools such as [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3). However, many educators remain unsure of how (or whether) to make use of this new class of tools. If we adopt a "wait-and-see" stance to these emerging tools, however, we risk surrendering our professional initiative to people unfamiliar with the classroom environment, such as policymakers and commercial interests. 

In this workshop, I argue that we as educators can improve our working conditions (and our students' learning conditions) if we engage in personal, direct, open exploration of generative AI tools. By the end of this workshop, I hope you will have a stronger understanding of what generative AI tools are; how they work; and how to explore their uses in your educational praxis.

## From Hesitation to Action

### Dipping Our Toes In

- **It's hard to know where to start:** See the demos and "additional resources" sections below for lists of tools and examples of their usage.

- **Overcoming Barriers:** The best ways to build confidence in generative AI tools are to **cultivate a sense of what's possible** by exploring others' work and to **develop hands-on experience** through personal experimentation with the tools.

### Our Role as Professionals

- **Take the Reins:** As professionals, it's up to us to take initiative to establish best practices for emerging tools.

- **Guide the Future:** Our judgment and expertise is needed to guide the ethical and impactful integration of AI in education.

- **We're Not In It Alone:** As with other forms of educational praxis, we should innovate openly and collectively.

## Conclusion

- **The Future Begins Today:** Let's not wait for commercial interests to reshape the landscape of education around us. We should embrace our role as professionals and act as leaders in the innovative use of technology in teaching and learning.
  
- **Collective Empowerment:** Our exploration and adoption of AI tools are not just individual pursuits, but a collective journey towards enhancing educational praxis. Sharing our findings and best practices enriches the entire educational community.

- **The Power of Possibility:** As we've seen today, the potential applications of generative AI in education are vast and varied. Let's continue to experiment, innovate, and share, driven by the belief that together, we can redefine the boundaries of what's possible in education.

## Additional Resources

### Prompt engineering and repositories

- Here is one common framework for how to assign a task to a conversational AI:
    1. **Tell it who you are.** Example: "I'm an ESL instructor developing study materials."
    2. **Tell it what the project is.** Example: "I'm looking for texts that effectively illustrate the meanings of target vocabulary words for my students."
    3. **Tell it what you want it to do.** Example: "I want you to write a paragraph that uses each of these target vocabulary words one time."
    4. **Tell it how to write the output.** Example: "The paragraph should be about ... The level of complexity should be ... Use/avoid this grammar ..."

    - [Create Keynote](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/create_keynote/system.md) prompt that instructs the AI to create a slide-by-slide plan for a presentation

    - [Extract Wisdom](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/extract_wisdom/system.md) prompt that instructs the AI to "extract surprising, insightful, and interesting information from text content"
