# Let’s Demystify AI and Take Initiative: A Workshop By and For Educators

#### Bill Price, with AI assistance

## Introduction

Generative AI has exploded into the public consciousness over the last year and a half, including text-based tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and image-based tools such as [DALL·E](https://openai.com/dall-e-3). However, many educators remain unsure of how (or whether) to make use of this new class of tools. If we adopt a "wait-and-see" stance to these emerging tools, however, we risk losing our professional initiative to people unfamiliar with the classroom environment, such as policymakers and commercial interests. 

In this workshop, I argue that we as educators can improve our working conditions (and our students' learning conditions) if we engage in personal, direct, open exploration of generative AI tools. By the end of this workshop, I hope you will have a stronger understanding of what generative AI tools are; how they work; and how to explore their uses in your educational praxis.

## Additional Resources

Certainly! Here's an updated markdown-formatted list of chat-based generative AI tools, now including Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, the GPT4All ecosystem, and the LM Studio ecosystem, alongside ChatGPT.

### Chat-Based Generative AI Tools

#### Commercial and online

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): A conversational AI developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text responses. It's known for its wide range of applications, from answering questions to writing creative content.

- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com): A conversational AI developed by Google, designed to provide information and perform tasks through natural language understanding.

- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/): Microsoft's conversational AI assistant that integrates with various Microsoft products to enhance productivity by automating tasks, generating content, and providing insights based on natural language prompts.

#### Open-Source and offline

- [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/): A free program for downloading and running open-source conversational AIs locally on your own computer. As of March 2024, I recommend using the model called Nous Hermes 2 Mistral DPO.

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/): Similar to GPT4All, but considered to be less user-friendly and more advanced.

These tools represent the cutting edge of conversational AI technology, each offering unique features and capabilities designed to assist users in different contexts, from professional environments to personal projects.
