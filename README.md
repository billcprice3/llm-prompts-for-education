# llm-prompts-for-education

I am an educator. This is a repository of prompts I have developed for use in curricula I have taught.

Students have used LLMs of their choice (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) to run these prompts.

- [LLM Prompts for Education](readme.md): Bill Price's repository of prompts.

- [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/tree/main/patterns): A repository of prompts by Daniel Miessler. They are not specific to education, but provide excellent examples of what an engineered prompt can look like. See some of Miessler's examples below:

    - [Create Keynote](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/create_keynote/system.md) prompt that instructs the AI to create a slide-by-slide plan for a presentation

    - [Extract Wisdom](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric/blob/main/patterns/extract_wisdom/system.md) prompt that instructs the AI to "extract surprising, insightful, and interesting information from text content"

## Chat-Based Generative AI Tools (as of March 2024)

### Commercial (online)

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): A conversational AI developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text responses. It's known for its wide range of applications, from answering questions to writing creative content.

- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com): A conversational AI developed by Google, designed to provide information and perform tasks through natural language understanding.

- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/): Microsoft's conversational AI assistant that integrates with various Microsoft products to enhance productivity by automating tasks, generating content, and providing insights based on natural language prompts.

### Open-Source (offline)

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/): Similar to GPT4All, but considered to be less user-friendly and more advanced.

## Image-Based Generative AI Tools

- [DALL·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3/): Powers the image creation of ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot.
