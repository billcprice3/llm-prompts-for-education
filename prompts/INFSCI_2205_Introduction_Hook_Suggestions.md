# Notes 

- The purpose of this experiment was as an ideation tool. It was emphasized to students that the final text should be their own work, but that seeing several possible ideas for what a hook might look like can help us break through writer's block.
- The first prompt, asking the LLM to explain what makes for an effective hook in the introduction of an academic argumentative essay, builds context about what makes an effective hook. LLMs often seem to perform a task better if they are pushed to "meditate" first on what an effective output would look like.

## GPT-4o:

An effective hook in the introduction of an academic argumentative essay is crucial for grabbing the reader's attention and encouraging them to engage with the essay. Here are key elements that make a hook effective:

1. **Relevance to the Topic**: The hook should be closely related to the essay's main argument or topic. It needs to create a bridge to the thesis statement, ensuring the reader understands why the issue matters.

2. **Clear and Concise**: Academic readers appreciate precision. The hook should be succinct, setting the tone and focus of the essay without overwhelming the reader with unnecessary details.

3. **Provocative or Thought-Provoking**: A strong hook challenges readers to think, question, or reconsider something. It might present a startling fact, ask a rhetorical question, or highlight a common misconception.

4. **Engages the Reader’s Curiosity**: An effective hook makes the reader want to know more. It raises interest in the subject by posing a problem or presenting a situation that the reader will want to see resolved in the body of the essay.

5. **Establishes Context**: Especially in an argumentative essay, the hook should provide a hint of the broader context or significance of the topic. This helps the reader understand the issue’s scope and importance before diving into your argument.

6. **Relatable or Unusual Examples**: Sometimes, opening with an interesting anecdote, hypothetical situation, or analogy can help to make complex academic topics more relatable or accessible to the audience.

An effective hook sets the stage for a compelling, well-argued essay while aligning closely with the topic and purpose of the writing.
