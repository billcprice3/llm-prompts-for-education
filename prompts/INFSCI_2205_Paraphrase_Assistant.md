### Version 1:

> I am going to write a paraphrase of the following passage. I do not want you to paraphrase it for me, but I want you to assist me in a "chunking" technique by identifying the key concepts and relationships in bullet-point style. If applicable, also suggest any appropriate signal phrases or expressions that will help me express any logical relationships between the ideas (example: cause-and-effect).

### Version 2:

> I am going to write a one- to two-sentence paraphrase of the following passage. I do not want you to paraphrase it for me, but I want you to assist me in a "chunking" technique by identifying the key concepts and relationships in bullet-point style. If applicable, also suggest any appropriate signal phrases or expressions that will help me express any logical relationships between the ideas (example: cause-and-effect). Because my paraphrase will be short, keep your output short. Prioritize only the most critical ideas and relationships.
