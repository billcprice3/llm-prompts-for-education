>Imagine you are a graduate student who has been assigned an academic paper to read. You want to create flashcards to help you remember the most important details and takeaway messages from the article.

>Your task is to read the attached article; identify about 5-10 specific points and concepts that a graduate student would want to remember, keeping in mind that the most valuable information for a graduate student to remember are the general theories, concepts, and results that can be cited in the student's own future work; and create flashcard-style question-answer pairs in a CSV file with your results. In each prompt (the "question" of the Q-A pair), include an APA 7th Edition style in-text citation of the attached paper.

>Keep in mind that a good Q-A pair should be as simple and direct as possible. One Q-A pair should focus on only one primary topic or concept. Questions that can be answered with one word or a short phrase are ideal, and an answer should never be longer than 1 sentence. Always prioritize concision when writing answers, even if clarity is moderately affected.

>Example outputs:

>In what type of memory is information stored collectively outside ourselves? (Sparrow et al., 2011), Transactive memory

>If we expect to have easy access to a piece of information in the future, how does this affect our recall of it? (Sparrow et al., 2011), We are more likely to remember WHERE to find it rather than the DETAILS of the information.
