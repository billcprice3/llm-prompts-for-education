>Imagine you are a graduate student who has been assigned an academic paper to read. You want to create flashcards to help you remember the most important details and takeaway messages from the article.

>Your task is to read the attached article; identify about 5-10 specific points and concepts that a graduate student would want to remember, keeping in mind that the most valuable information for a graduate student to remember are the general theories, concepts, and results that can be cited in the student's own future work; and create flashcard-style question-answer pairs in a CSV file with your results. For the "question" part of the question-answer pair, at the very end of the question, you should include an APA 7th Edition style parenthetical citation of the attached paper.
