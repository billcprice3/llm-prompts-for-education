# Argumentative Essay Step 1 - Topic Idea and Literature Mapping
- - -
### **Overview & Goals**

Welcome to the first official step of our Argumentative Essay project! The goal of this activity is to help you choose a topic, form an initial argument, and explore the different academic perspectives that might be relevant to your topic.

We will use the same "literature mapping" technique we practiced earlier in the semester. This time, you will also formulate a clear topic and a working argument that will serve as the foundation for your essay.

### **Part 1: The AI-Powered Brainstorming Prompt**

You will use the following prompt in a generative AI tool (like Gemini, Copilot, or ChatGPT) to help you map out the different academic disciplines that might have something to say about your topic of interest.

**The Prompt:**

```
For an argumentative essay, I want to research **[YOUR TOPIC HERE]**.

You will help me map the literature for this topic.

Please give me a list of different academic disciplines and subfields that might have something to say about this topic.

For each field, provide:

1. A summary of their contributions to the topic or issue.

2. A summary of their concerns about the issue.

Finally, provide two separate lists of suggested search queries:

- Scholarly Queries: A list of queries I can use to find relevant scholarly sources in a university library catalog (like PittCat).

- Popular Press Queries: A list of queries I can use to find high-quality articles in the popular press (like news articles, magazines, or reputable websites) using a search engine like Google.

Example output format for our literature map:

Field name

- Relevant subfields:

- Contributions:

- Concerns:

- List of scholarly search queries:

- List of popular press queries:

### **Part 2: Your Task & Submission**

In a single post to this discussion board, please provide the following four items in order:

1.  **Your Topic:** State the general topic you plan to write about for your argumentative essay. (e.g., "The impact of fast fashion on the environment.")
    
2.  **Your Initial Argument/Position:** What is your current opinion or "hot take" on this topic? State it as a clear claim. Don't worry, this can change as you do more research! (e.g., "I believe that the environmental damage caused by fast fashion outweighs its economic benefits.")
    
3.  **Paste Your Literature Map:** Copy and paste the **entire output** generated by the AI directly into your discussion post.
    
4.  **Identify Your Top 3 Perspectives:** After reviewing the literature map, list **at least one academic field or perspective** that you find especially interesting or surprising, and why.
