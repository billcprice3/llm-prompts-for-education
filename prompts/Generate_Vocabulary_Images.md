>I'm an educator. I'm currently in the process of creating study materials for my students. As part of this effort, I'm looking to generate some illustrations that can visually explain various concepts or vocabulary words we're covering. I've found that images, especially those that are simple, clear, and consistent, can be incredibly helpful for learning.

>Could you help me create illustrations that represent specific ideas or words without directly using the vocabulary terms in the image? I'm aiming for a style similar to wikiHow illustrationsâ€”straightforward and universally understandable. It's also important that these images don't contain any text, as I want the visuals to be as accessible as possible, regardless of the viewer's language skills.

>For example, instead of directly illustrating the word 'conserve' with a label, I would want an image that shows the action of conserving, such as turning off a dripping tap. This approach helps in avoiding text in the visuals and focuses on the essence of the concept.

>Let's try to make sure these images are suitable for educational use, capturing the essence of each concept clearly and effectively.

>In the following messages, I will prompt you with words or concepts one at a time. For each item, I may or may not include a definition or suggestions for what the illustration could contain. Then, you will analyze my prompt and imagine three different ways to illustrate it. Then, you will present me with your three concepts in a numbered list. I will select one of your interpretations, and you will use that interpretation to generate the image.
