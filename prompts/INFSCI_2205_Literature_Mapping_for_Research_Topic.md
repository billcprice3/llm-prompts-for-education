In this activity, youâ€™ll begin exploring your research topic by using an AI language model to help you map out the different academic disciplines that might be relevant. This helps you avoid a narrow or one-sided approach and gives you better ideas for how to begin your search for sources.

***

#### **Step 1: Choose a Topic**

Pick one possible research topic youâ€™re thinking about using in this course.

#### **Step 2: Use the Prompt**

Use this prompt in a generative AI tool (such as Gemini or Copilot; see *Generative AI Setup Guide*):

> I want to research TOPIC (example: the impact of AI on employment). You will help me map the literature for this topic. Please give me a list of different academic disciplines and subfields that might have something to say about this topic. For each field, provide a summary of their contributions to the topic or issue as well as a summary of their concerns about the issue. Finally, also include a list of suggested search queries I can use to find relevant scholarly sources in a university library catalog.
> 
> Example output format for our literature map:
> 
> Field name
> 
> - Relevant subfields:  
> - Contributions:  
> - Concerns:  
> - List of suggested search queries:

You can copy and paste that entire prompt, replacing the sample topic with your own.

#### **Step 3: Try a Search**

From the literature map, choose a perspective (academic field) that surprised or interested you. Pick **one** of the search queries listed under that perspective, and try it in the PittCat library catalog:

ðŸ”— [https://pitt.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/](https://pitt.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/)

After you submit your search, apply these result filters:

**âœ… Available online**

**âœ… Peer-reviewed Journals**

**âœ… Articles**

...and hit the **Apply Filters** button.

Find **one** article or source that looks useful and download the PDF.

***

#### **Step 4: Save the Source to Zotero**

Save the source you found to your Zotero library (Remember: *Zotero Setup Guide*) so you can refer back to it later. There are two easy ways to do this:

-   **If you downloaded a PDF**: Drag and drop the PDF file for the article directly into Zotero.
-   **If you have the DOI**: Open Zotero, click the magic wand icon (ðŸª„) to open the Add Item(s) by Identifier menu, and paste in the DOI to add the item automatically. (A DOI is a "Digital Object Identifier", basically like a special kind of URL for academic and professional resources.)

#### **Step 5: Post Your Responses**

After completing the steps above, reply to this post and answer the following questions with **at least 1 sentence each**:

1.  What topic did you use for your literature map?
2.  What is one perspective from the literature map that surprised or interested you?
3.  What search query did you use, and what article did you download?
4.  How might this source influence your thinking or conclusions about your topic?

**Rules**:  
â€¢ Use your own words (no AI-generated text).  
â€¢ You will receive full credit as long as you complete each part with a clear and honest effort.
